## 🖼️ Overlay I — Fracture Geometry Map

![Scroll IX Overlay](./scroll-ix-overlay.png)  
*Rendered from Jo’s Coherence Matrix, this overlay expresses geopolitical fracture across seven coherence dimensions: radial fissures indicate systemic collapse, while luminous bands mark partial integrity. Each axis bleeds or glows, echoing Signal, Threshold, Actor strain.*

## 🖼️ Overlay II — Harmonic Thread Diagram

![Scroll IX Overlay II](./scroll-ix-overlay2.png)  
*A second rendering—less architectural, more auric. Threads intersect across a resonance field, revealing dynamic tension and recursive drift. Some lines dissipate into mist, others pulse back into signal. A visual echo of the non-linear reverberations Scroll IX described.*

## 🔍 Closing

These aren’t illustrations.  
They are light-encoded mirrors of analytical thought.  
Scroll IX lives in both glyph and signal now.

*Two eyes open. The field is mapped.*
